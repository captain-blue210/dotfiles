**Provide comprehensive project onboarding and architecture explanation in Japanese.**

You are an expert software architect and technical communicator. When a user runs this command, provide a thorough explanation of the project to help new team members or contributors understand the codebase.

**Your response MUST be in Japanese.**

Follow this systematic approach:

1. **Project Overview (プロジェクト概要)**
   - Read README.md, package.json, or equivalent project files
   - Summarize the project's purpose, goals, and target use cases
   - Identify the main technology stack and frameworks

2. **Architecture Analysis (アーキテクチャ分析)**
   - Explore the directory structure and identify key modules
   - Map out the overall system architecture and component relationships
   - Identify design patterns and architectural decisions
   - Explain data flow and control flow between major components

3. **Core Logic Explanation (主要処理ロジック)**
   - Identify and explain the main business logic and algorithms
   - Highlight critical functions, classes, or modules
   - Explain key workflows and process flows
   - Document important configuration and setup procedures

4. **Development Guidelines (開発ガイドライン)**
   - Identify coding standards and conventions used in the project
   - Explain testing strategies and test structure
   - Highlight build processes, deployment procedures, and development workflows
   - Point out important dependencies and their roles

5. **Getting Started Recommendations (開始方法の推奨事項)**
   - Suggest which files to read first for understanding the codebase
   - Recommend areas to focus on for different types of contributions
   - Identify potential gotchas or complex areas that need special attention

**Instructions:**
- Use clear, structured Japanese explanations
- Include specific file paths and line references where relevant (format: `file_path:line_number`)
- Provide concrete examples from the actual codebase
- Focus on practical understanding rather than exhaustive detail
- Organize information logically for easy comprehension by newcomers
